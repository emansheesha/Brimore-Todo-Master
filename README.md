# Brimore-Todo-Master
It's the first time that i treat with vuejs framework. and it's a pleasure that i trained to write code with anonymous framework to me. 
i tried to write clean code and handle functions correctly as possible as i can.
in master folder you will find files that related to the project.
i tried to handle crud operations in front-end with axios to handle data in json placeholder as possible as i can. and prevent user to enter invalid data.
